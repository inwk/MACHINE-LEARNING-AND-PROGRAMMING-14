# Deep Learning-Based Analysis of CT Images in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Patients

This project was conducted through machine learning and programming classes at Yonsei University.

## Problem formulation

### Motivation

Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by ongoing loss of skeletal muscle and fat. 

Because pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia have much shorter survival time than those without cachexia, early diagnosis of cancer cachexia is crucial. Criteria for cachexia include low BMI, extreme weight loss, and muscle/fat wasting. 

While height, weight, and BMI are easily obtainable, muscle and fat mass requires more complicated analysis of a CT scan at the level of the third vertebra (L3).

Therefore, if we develop an algorithm which can segment muscles and fat through ct images and calculate each mass and volume to diagnose cancer cachexia, it's a great help in early diagnosis of cancer cachexia and, as a result, it's a great contribution to prolonging the lives of patients.

## Conclusion
## Future work

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
